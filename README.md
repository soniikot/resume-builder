# React CV/Resume Generator Project

## Introduction
In this project, I created a small application where users can input their information and generate a CV/résumé. This project covers basic React concepts including:
* useState hook,
* useEffect hook,
* pagination,
* building a custome hook for using local storage
* form validation 


## General Information Section:
Input fields for name, email, and phone number
Edit and submit buttons
Educational Experience Section:
Input fields for school name, title of study, and date of study
Edit and submit buttons
Practical Experience Section:
Input fields for company name, position title, main responsibilities, date from, and until when you worked for that company
Edit and submit buttons
The submit button should submit the form and display the input values in HTML elements. The edit button should add back the input fields with the previously displayed information as values, allowing users to edit and resubmit the content.
