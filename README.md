# React CV/Resume Generator Project

## Introduction
In this project, I created a small application where users can input their information and generate a CV/résumé. This project covers basic React concepts including:
* useState hook,
* useEffect hook,
* pagination,
* building a custom hook for using local storage
* form validation 


## Aims:
* Build input fields for contact, experience, education, and skills
* Validate some forms to ensure user input is correct
* Store the information in local storage to persist data
* Create a resume based on user inputs, excluding empty sections
* Divide the application into different pages for a better user experience
